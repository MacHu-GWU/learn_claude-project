Public Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you create a public project, it offers a collaborative yet controlled environment within your company. Here are two important aspects to understand:

**Project Ownership and Editing Rights**

While everyone in your company can view public projects, only you—as the project owner—have the ability to modify core project elements including:

- Project description
- Project name
- Knowledge base configuration

If team members need to make modifications, they should create their own private version of the project using the same instructions, description, and knowledge base. This approach maintains project integrity while enabling individual customization.

**Chat Privacy in Public Projects**

Although the project itself is public, chat conversations maintain strict privacy controls:

- All team members can initiate chats within public projects
- Chat messages are only visible to their creator
- Chat privacy is enforced by default, ensuring conversation confidentiality

These features balance open access to project resources with appropriate privacy and control measures, enabling team collaboration while protecting individual work.
